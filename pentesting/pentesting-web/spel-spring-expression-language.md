# SpEL - Spring Expression Language

**POST COPIED FROM** [**https://medium.com/@xvnpw/hacking-spel-part-1-d2ff2825f62a**](https://medium.com/@xvnpw/hacking-spel-part-1-d2ff2825f62a)\*\*\*\*

This story will explain how to find and exploit SpEL parser in web applications based on Java language.

What is SpEL ? From Spring documentation: _The Spring Expression Language \(SpEL for short\) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime._

Where is it used ?

1. Spring Framework: Security, Data, â€¦
2. **Any place developers use it by SpEL API**
3. For languages it can be used in Java, Kotlin, Scala, and other JVM based technologies.

First point is known by issues in past like: [CVE-2018â€“1273](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2018-1273), [CVE-2017â€“8046](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2017-8046) or CVE-2011â€“2730. I will not talk about them, I will focus on point number two.

## SpEL API <a id="385e"></a>

Most common use cases for SpEL that I have seen in web applications:

* complex expressions using custom function calls: `fun1("some string") ? "text" : fun2("some other string")`
* dynamic code evaluation: `T(org.springframework.util.StreamUtils).copy(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec`â€¦

Any of user input can be part of expression. Also input can be expression as a whole. Those above use cases are good indicators what to look for in web apps. Key words: **expression**, **mapping**, **dynamic** ðŸ˜ƒ

## Payloads <a id="adba"></a>

From you have already see I bet you know what is coming. If developers are using SpEL with user input, we need to create payload with injection. Letâ€™s check one that allow remote code execution \(RCE\). It was created as part of exploit for [CVE-2017â€“8046](https://github.com/m3ssap0/SpringBreakVulnerableApp).![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qyl6ZLeJOyXmxmdqMcT8tg.png?q=20)

It consist of 3 parts:

* black color â€” copy result of command execution directly to output stream of HTTP request
* red color â€” get Java Runtime and execute command in system
* blue color â€” String containing command: `cmd /c dir`. To make it more robust individual characters of command are decoded from numbers.

Result of executing it:

Code of intentionally vulnerable web application:

Keep in mind:

* payload is working in some of Blind scenarios â€” always copy result to HTTP response
* can be tune to work on Linux â€” just remove `cmd /c` and it should work out-of-box
* in real world you will need probably first break out of string to inject this or do other tricks that are common for injection attacks
* it can be used with multiple versions of String Framework and Java

Here is payload to copy:

The other interesting payload is this one:![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*rUpqxczgG-FYMrhdW23KsA.png?q=20)

Itâ€™s far less complicated but short and powerful. Itâ€™s also not using `T(...)` syntax and no constructor is used. Itâ€™s just executing methods and accessing properties. I will show in next part why it does matter.

## Summary <a id="85bc"></a>

That will be all for this part. I have explained what is SpEL API and how to exploit it. In next part I will deep dive into Spring source code to show how exactly it works.
